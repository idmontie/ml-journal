## What the heck is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. With Machine Learning, we try to effectively perform a task without knowing the explicit instructions to accomplish that task. Instead, we rely on patterns and inference to perform the task.

> Machine learning is the process of creating a statistical model from various types
of data that perform various functions without having to be programmed by a human. Deep learning is
a type of machine learning based on neural network algorithms, used to produce more accurate
insights, recommendations, and predictions, trained on large amounts of data.

## Boiling it down

At it's core, Machine Learning is about trying to find an algorithm that best maps new data to a predicted value. So, given a general statement `Y = f(x)`, Machine Learning will help us discover the function, _f_, that best maps some data we have to the known values, _(x, y)_, so that we can make predictions on new data.
